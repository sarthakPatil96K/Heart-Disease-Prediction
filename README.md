# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to **predict whether a person has heart disease** based on medical attributes. The goal is to build a reliable model using various classification algorithms and Python data science libraries.

---

## 📌 Problem Definition

Given a set of medical features (e.g., age, cholesterol, chest pain type, etc.), can we predict whether or not a patient has heart disease?
